# Installation
After you've downloaded the files, you have 3 options to 'install' this tool.

* Download this repository and put the downloaded files in your Assets/ folder.

## Palettes
Palettes are 'painting presets'. You can for example create a 'Trees' that contains 3 different types of trees.
You can manage your palettes using the palette toolbar. You can use the 'Load' button to load a custom palette from your project folder, or you can create a new palette by clicking 'palettes > New Palette'. After you've edited a palette, don't forget to save it.
You can relocate or rename palettes however you want.
